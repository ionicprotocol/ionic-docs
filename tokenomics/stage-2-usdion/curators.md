# Curators

Curators are the individuals responsible for the creation of Supply Vaults and the allocation of capital deposited. When deploying vaults, curators are able to set their own performance fee, which is earned as a % of interest generated by deposits into the vault. At this time, the maximum fee that can be set on a vault is 50%.

Currently, the role of Curators is permissioned and determined by Ionic Protocol; however, upon the release of Ionic Score, users with a certain score are able to permissionlessly become Curators.
