# Tokenomics

ION is Ionic Protocolâ€™s native utility token. The ION token will be used as an incentive to both suppliers and borrowers within the Ionic ecosystem. However, only users with at least **2.5%** of their collateral position locked as [$veION ](veion.md)are eligible to receive emissions.

ION emissions to specific collateral assets within the protocol are subject to vote by $veION holders every epoch. Additionally, while $veION holders will vote on specific assets to incentivize, emissions to lenders and borrowers will be dictated by that assets utilization rate.

Users receiving ION emissions are able to either claim or one-click LP and stake their emissions as $veION directly through the Ionic front-end UI.
